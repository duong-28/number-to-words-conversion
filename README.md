#Number to Words Converter

- Live at: https://duong-28.github.io/number-to-words-conversion/ 
- This project provides a simple JavaScript solution to convert integer numbers (whole numbers) into their corresponding English word representation.
> Features
- Converts integer numbers (0 to 9999 inclusively) into English words.
- Does not yet process decimal numbers. Any numbers entered after the decimal point will be ignored, and only the integer portion will be converted to words.  
- Negative numbers are not supported. The tool will return an error message if a number outside the supported range (0 to 9999) is provided.
